# Water Sort Puzzle Bottle Game

Greetings, Python Enthusiasts!

I'm thrilled to share with you the 'Water Sort Puzzle Bottle Game,' a collaborative project developed in conjunction with enthusiastic students from the [Python Help](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770989141134671925/1160185849334464573/Python_help_-_Aulas_particulares.pdf?ex=6533be45&is=65214945&hm=677f726106df35d432bc6bc649894043d88e37f308f54047fed8e4c00b671dae&) program. Together, we embarked on a journey to create an interactive and engaging Python game that not only enhances their programming skills but also provides a fun learning experience.

## Project Overview:

The Water Sort Puzzle Bottle Game is a Python-based puzzle game where players aim to organize liquids in bottles following specific rules. The game involves strategic moves to avoid errors and fill bottles correctly.
